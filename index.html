         <h1> St. Louis </h1>
         <p> I have lived in St. Louis, Missouri my entire life. St. Louis is a unique city with wonderful people. Its known for the Gateway Arch, Cardinals games at Busch Stadium, the great Forest Park, and many other fun places. My favorite things to do are take a walk through Tower Grove Park, have a picnic on Art Hill in the summer and go sledding in the winter. Those who haven't went sledding down Art Hill are truly missing out! I also love to go thrifting and have a nice dinner or brunch at the Delmar Loop. There are many great places to visit and eat at the Loop and its always nice to end a great day with some ice cream from Ben & Jerry's. The Botanical Garden is somewhere I love to visit with family, with multiple beautiful sites. Most importantly, St. Louis is where I have met the people who have influenced who I am and helped me get to this point in my journey. </p>

      <article> <h1> Washington University in St. Louis </h1>
      <p> Growing up in St. Louis, I always admired the WashU campus and looked forward to attending a University just like it. I did not imagine that I would be accepted and when I was it was a very proud moment for me. The campus is beautiful with amazing views and traditional buildings that remind you of being in Hogwarts from Harry Potter. Upon getting accepted, I thought my ultimate goal was to become a Pediatrician since I'm great with kids and wanted to dedicate my career to helping others. After many pre-med courses and getting firsthand knowledge into what a career in medicine would be like, I realized medicine was not the path for me.  </p>
      <p> I ended up graduating with a degree in Psychology and Sociology. During my last semester at WashU, I decided to try a course that had honestly been on my mind since my first semester at the university: Introduction to Computer Science. The Mckelvey Engineering School always intrigued me, but due to my rigourous pre-med course schedule, I believed I did not have time or space in my schedule to explore it. I'm so glad I took that chance in my last semester to see what the world of Computer Science was like. I ended up enjoying the course so much that it led me down the path of pursuing a career in Software Developing.

      <h1> My Self-Taught Journey</h1>
      <p> Since I discovered my passion for Computer Science a little too late at WashU, upon graduation, I began doing resarch on how to pursue a career in Software Development. I learned that I could go back to college to take the necessary courses, get into a program/bootcamp, or begin teaching myself like many great programmers have done. I couldn't wait to begin learning, so I decided to teach myself while looking into applying to universities and programs. I utilized websites like FreeCodeCamp, Youtube, ______, etc. I learned a lot throughout my self-taught journey. </p>

      <h1> Launchcode! </h1>
      <p>While speaking to a mentor from WashU about the next steps for me after college, I learned about Launchcode. I will always be grateful to this person for telling me about this great program where I have already learned so much in two and a half months. As soon as I learned about it, I knew I had to apply. I was so excited upon recieving the email that I had been accepted into the June 2024 cohort. I have already learned so much in the short time I have been a part of Launchcode. Although, I am taking part as a beginner, I look forward to becoming a great Software Develoer and making really creative projects. I hope to use combine everything I have learned throughout my journey, both during my time at WashU and Launchcode! </p> </article>
